<h2>Geriatric Care Manager:</h2>
</hgroup>
</header>
<p class="jose">The Geriatric Care Manager is traditionally the user who is enrolling in the Geriatricsconcern.com site
and has complete administrative capabilities, along with the Geriatric Client, to all data and aspects 
of the site. The Geriatric Manager and the Geriatric Client essentially can be the same individual, though 
it is recommended for the roles to be separate. At the time of initial enrollment and billing, the customer is 
required to populate the Geriatric Client and Geriatric Manager data points. This includes name and 
contact information for both parties along with some additional criteria related to the Geriatric Client. 
All other data points in Geriatricsconcern.com can be input by the Geriatric Manager (or Geriatric 
Client) at time of enrollment, or at any time subsequent to the registration process. A single Geriatric 
Manager can enroll and administer more than one Geriatric Client; e.g. mother and father. There is no 
limitation to the number of Geriatric Clients a Geriatric Manager can maintain from the site.</P>
